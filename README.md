### Vibe

Vibe lets you control the system’s vibe—through ambient messaging and customizable theming. Customize the look and feel of the interface to match the message, creating a cohesive experience that feels intentional, not noisy. Vibe keeps everyone aligned by combining communication and visual tone into a single, shared layer.
